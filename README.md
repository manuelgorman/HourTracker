HourTracker
===========

A small web thing to keep track of the hours I work

===========

This is just a little project I made to stop myself losing bits of paper with my hours written on. I don't really condone using this project for a while. I mean, c'mon. It uses PHPython. Not to mention that I've just realised how many credentials I've left in all the files, fuck.

If you decide to use this for whatever reason, dump hours.py in your cgi-bin folder and index.html in whichever folder you like (i.e /apps/hours). You need to add the columns "date", "start", "end" (and "susan" which will be removed because not everyone has a terrifying manager)
