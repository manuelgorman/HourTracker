HourTracker
===========

A small web thing to keep track of the hours I work

===========

This is just a little project I made to stop myself losing bits of paper with my hours written on. I don't really condone using this project for a while. I mean, c'mon. It uses PHPython. Not to mention that I've just realised how many credentials I've left in all the files, fuck. Anyway if you do decide to use it for whatever reason, I'll make it easier to modify and I'll include details in this readme for what columns you need in your MySQL table.
