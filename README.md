HourTracker
===========

A small web thing to keep track of the hours I work

===========

This is just a little project I made to stop myself losing bits of paper with my hours written on. While it has now moved on from the horrible days of PHPython, it now uses some mashup of Python, JavaScript and jQuery. It works, and it can be used, but I don't recommend it.

If you decide to use this for whatever reason, dump hours.py in your cgi-bin folder and index.html in whichever folder you like (i.e /apps/hours). You need to add the columns "date", "start", "end" (and "susan" which will be removed because not everyone has a terrifying manager)
